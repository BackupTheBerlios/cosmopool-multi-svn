Here's a very primitive installation manual, but more than nothing. If you've got questions,
just comment this page.

* Check out the CVS-Tree(Link einf√ºgen)
* Now you've got the folder "idontknow". Copy it on your webserver.
* There's a subfolder "config" with a file "config.ini" in it. Edit it.
* Create a database "pools". There's not yet an easy way to change the db's name.
* Execute the sql-files in subfolder "sql" on the datebase.
* These contain the database-tables and also one pool ("main pool") 
and one user called "admin" with the password "cosmopool". This user is the administrator of "main pool",
which is a pool every registered user is a member of.  
* Now the software should be running.[1]
* The first thing you should do is to login as "admin" and change
this user's password.
